An idea for an app that I have been wanting to make is one where people are able to find local animal shelters. The user would be able to view images of the animals in that shelter by scrolling through a list along with the description of the animal and the shelter's contact information. They would also have access to a map where the nearest shelters are displayed, which the number of shelters can change by modifying a range.

## Notes

Whie creating this application, I originally wanted to create a 'bold' button that would allow the user to bold the text that was currently being displayed on the screen. However, I had difficulty in the beginning finding how to do this as there I was unsure which function in the UILabel class could modify the text to make bold. Instead, I settled on more useful idea of hiding and showing the text in case the user did not want to see it.
